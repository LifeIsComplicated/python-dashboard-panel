# python-dashboard-panel

The main advantage of Panel is that it allows to go from Jupyter notebooks to UI.

Panel is developped by Anaconda.

python3 -m venv ./

source bin/activate

pip3 install hvplot jupyterlab

deactivate the environment

pip3 install panel

reactivate the environment with source bin/activate

jupyter lab

write your notebook.

Run the "panel serve" instruction. It will open a https: link, click on the link and you'll visualize the dashboard.
